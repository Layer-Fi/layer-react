manage uploads button
 - this could be beside the upload button
   PROS: Easier to discover
   CONS: takes up more space for an edge case probably why the button is really small
 - below the upload transaction manually
   PROS: its in a natural place under the existing button option
   CONS: Might be hard to see but users only need to worry about that for manual entries so they would have seen it before

When button is clicked it should open up a modal that will have a similar UI to the existing Upload transactions but will say Manage transactions
subheading will say (Group delete transaction by date)

under it should have a table view with each row as an accordion that contains another table with a list of their transactions. we could call it transaction snippet as we might just want to show the first 10 and won't need pagination
The main table rows should show
-upload date
-upload source
-transaction count
-account
-delete button we might want to have a "warning" that the data will be archived for X amount of data and they can have a final confirmation setPageIndex


API requests needed
- GET: A list of the "upload batches" and the top 10 transaction Categories
   *considerations*
   -single get request with a join for upload batches and the transactions
    PROS: frontend makes a request and each paginated response will contain a fixed amount of batches and transactions
    CONS: Might be some work for the backend to handle and requirements might require more complex display of information or all transactions to show
   -2 API calls fetch upload batches and fetch the paginations for the uploads
    we could quicky fetch a paginated "upload batches" and display that while we fetch the transactions in the background
    PROS: Better UX on the frontend
    CONS: Might be some hydration issues

- UPDATE: Soft delete on the transactions
  This should mostly be done on the server to take the id of batches and set all the _isDeleted fields to true



Questions?
Do schemas represent the database schema too? this will make it easy to know what fields are available
Curious to know how the uploaded data is represented in the database. Is there a seperate table of uploaded docs and a foreign key on the transaction table

Schemas ill like to see
 - Transactions (documentIds?)
 - Uploads (looks like its the same as transactions)

  reads ill like to see
 - Transaction (useBankTransactionsContext)
 

 Mutations ill like to see
 - categorize transactions (useCategorizeBankTransaction)
 - Upload transactions (useCustomAccountParseCsv)
